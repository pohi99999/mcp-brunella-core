# Microservices Architecture - Container App Example

⏱️ **Estimated Time**: 25-35 minutes | 💰 **Estimated Cost**: ~$50-100/month | ⭐ **Complexity**: Advanced

**📚 Learning Path:**
- ← Previous: [Simple Flask API](../../../../examples/container-app/simple-flask-api) - Basics of a single container
- 🎯 **You Are Here**: Microservices Architecture (2-service foundation)
- → Next: [AI Integration](../../../../docs/ai-foundry) - Adding intelligence to your services
- 🏠 [Course Home](../../README.md)

---

A **simplified but functional** microservices architecture deployed to Azure Container Apps using AZD CLI. This example demonstrates service-to-service communication, container orchestration, and monitoring with a practical 2-service setup.

> **📚 Learning Approach**: This example starts with a minimal 2-service architecture (API Gateway + Backend Service) that you can actually deploy and learn from. After mastering this foundation, we provide guidance for expanding to a full microservices ecosystem.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this example, you will:
- Deploy multiple containers to Azure Container Apps
- Implement service-to-service communication with internal networking
- Configure environment-based scaling and health checks
- Monitor distributed applications with Application Insights
- Understand microservices deployment patterns and best practices
- Learn progressive expansion from simple to complex architectures

## Architecture

### Phase 1: What We're Building (Included in This Example)

    style AppInsights fill:#9C27B0,stroke:#7B1FA2,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```
**Component Details:**

| Component | Purpose | Access | Resources |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **API Gateway** | Routes external requests to backend services | Public (HTTPS) | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 2-20 replicas |
| **Product Service** | Manages product catalog with in-memory data | Internal only | 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 1-10 replicas |
| **Application Insights** | Centralized logging and distributed tracing | Azure Portal | 1-2 GB/month data ingestion |

**Why Start Simple?**
- ✅ Deploy and understand quickly (25-35 minutes)
- ✅ Learn core microservices patterns without complexity
- ✅ Working code you can modify and experiment with
- ✅ Lower cost for learning (~$50-100/month vs $300-1400/month)
- ✅ Build confidence before adding databases and message queues

**Analogy**: Think of this like learning to drive. You start with an empty parking lot (2 services), master the basics, then progress to city traffic (5+ services with databases).

### Phase 2: Future Expansion (Reference Architecture)

Once you master the 2-service architecture, you can expand to:

**What Each Component Does:**

**Infrastructure (infra/)**:
- `main.bicep`: Orchestrates all Azure resources and their dependencies
- `core/container-apps-environment.bicep`: Creates the Container Apps environment and Azure Container Registry
- `core/monitor.bicep`: Sets up Application Insights for distributed logging
- `app/*.bicep`: Individual container app definitions with scaling and health checks

**API Gateway (src/api-gateway/)**:
- Public-facing service that routes requests to backend services
- Implements logging, error handling, and request forwarding
- Demonstrates service-to-service HTTP communication

**Product Service (src/product-service/)**:
- Internal service with product catalog (in-memory for simplicity)
- REST API with health checks
- Example of backend microservice pattern

## Services Overview

### API Gateway (Node.js/Express)

**Port**: 8080  
**Access**: Public (external ingress)  
**Purpose**: Routes incoming requests to appropriate backend services  

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/products` - Forward to product service (list all)
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Forward to product service (get by ID)

**Key Features**:
- Request routing with axios
- Centralized logging
- Error handling and timeout management
- Service discovery via environment variables
- Application Insights integration

**Code Highlight** (`src/api-gateway/app.js`):
```javascript
// Internal service communication
app.get('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`, {
    timeout: 5000
  });
  res.json(response.data);
});
```

### Product Service (Python/Flask)

**Port**: 8000  
**Access**: Internal only (no external ingress)  
**Purpose**: Manages product catalog with in-memory data  

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /products` - List all products
- `GET /products/<id>` - Get product by ID

**Key Features**:
- RESTful API with Flask
- In-memory product store (simple, no database needed)
- Health monitoring with probes
- Structured logging
- Application Insights integration

**Data Model**:
```python
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "High-performance laptop",
  "price": 999.99,
  "stock": 50
}
```

**Why Internal Only?**
The product service is not exposed publicly. All requests must go through the API Gateway, which provides:
- Security: Controlled access point
- Flexibility: Can change backend without affecting clients
- Monitoring: Centralized request logging

## Understanding Service Communication

### How Services Talk to Each Other

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Gateway as API Gateway<br/>(Port 8080)
    participant Product as Product Service<br/>(Port 8000)
    participant AI as Application Insights
    
    User->>Gateway: GET /api/products
    Gateway->>AI: Log request
    Gateway->>Product: GET /products (internal HTTP)
    Product->>AI: Log query
    Product-->>Gateway: JSON response [5 products]
    Gateway->>AI: Log response
    Gateway-->>User: JSON response [5 products]
    
    Note over Gateway,Product: Internal DNS: http://product-service
    Note over User,AI: All communication logged and traced
```
In this example, the API Gateway communicates with the Product Service using **internal HTTP calls**:

```javascript
// API Gateway (src/api-gateway/app.js)
const PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL = process.env.PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL;

// Make internal HTTP request
const response = await axios.get(`${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`);
```

**Key Points**:

1. **DNS-Based Discovery**: Container Apps automatically provides DNS for internal services
   - Product Service FQDN: `product-service.internal.<environment>.azurecontainerapps.io`
   - Simplified as: `http://product-service` (Container Apps resolves it)

2. **No Public Exposure**: Product Service has `external: false` in Bicep
   - Only accessible within the Container Apps environment
   - Cannot be reached from the internet

3. **Environment Variables**: Service URLs are injected at deployment time
   - Bicep passes the internal FQDN to the gateway
   - No hardcoded URLs in application code

**Analogy**: Think of this like office rooms. The API Gateway is the reception desk (public-facing), and the Product Service is an office room (internal only). Visitors must go through reception to reach any office.

## Deployment Options

### Full Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure and both services
azd up
```

This deploys:
1. Container Apps environment
2. Application Insights
3. Container Registry
4. API Gateway container
5. Product Service container

**Time**: 8-12 minutes

### Deploy Individual Service

```bash
# Deploy only one service (after initial azd up)
azd deploy api-gateway

# Or deploy product service
azd deploy product-service
```

**Use Case**: When you've updated code in one service and want to redeploy only that service.

### Update Configuration

```bash
# Change scaling parameters
azd env set GATEWAY_MAX_REPLICAS 30

# Redeploy with new configuration
azd up
```

## Configuration

### Scaling Configuration

Both services are configured with HTTP-based autoscaling in their Bicep files:

**API Gateway**:
- Min replicas: 2 (always at least 2 for availability)
- Max replicas: 20
- Scale trigger: 50 concurrent requests per replica

**Product Service**:
- Min replicas: 1 (can scale to zero if needed)
- Max replicas: 10
- Scale trigger: 100 concurrent requests per replica

**Customize Scaling** (in `infra/app/*.bicep`):
```bicep
scale: {
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules: [
    {
      name: 'http-scale-rule'
      http: {
        metadata: {
          concurrentRequests: '100'  // Adjust this
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resource Allocation

**API Gateway**:
- CPU: 1.0 vCPU
- Memory: 2 GiB
- Reason: Handles all external traffic

**Product Service**:
- CPU: 0.5 vCPU
- Memory: 1 GiB
- Reason: Lightweight in-memory operations

### Health Checks

Both services include liveness and readiness probes:

```bicep
probes: [
  {
    type: 'Liveness'
    httpGet: {
      path: '/health'
      port: 8080
    }
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 30
  }
  {
    type: 'Readiness'
    httpGet: {
      path: '/health'
      port: 8080
    }
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 10
  }
]
```

**What This Means**:
- **Liveness**: If health check fails, Container Apps restarts the container
- **Readiness**: If not ready, Container Apps stops routing traffic to that replica

## Monitoring & Observability

### View Service Logs

```bash
# Stream logs from API Gateway
azd logs api-gateway --follow

# View recent product service logs
azd logs product-service --tail 100

# View all logs from both services
azd logs --follow
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[api-gateway] API Gateway listening on port 8080
[api-gateway] Product Service URL: http://product-service
[api-gateway] GET /api/products 200 - 45ms
[product-service] Retrieved 5 products
```

### Application Insights Queries

Access Application Insights in Azure Portal, then run these queries:

**Find Slow Requests**:
```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where duration > 1000  // Requests taking >1 second
| summarize count() by name, cloud_RoleName
| order by count_ desc
```

**Track Service-to-Service Calls**:
```kusto
dependencies
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where type == "Http"
| project timestamp, name, target, duration, success
| order by timestamp desc
```

**Error Rate by Service**:
```kusto
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize errorCount = count() by cloud_RoleName, type
| order by errorCount desc
```

**Request Volume Over Time**:
```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| summarize requestCount = count() by bin(timestamp, 5m), cloud_RoleName
| render timechart
```

### Access Monitoring Dashboard

```bash
# Get Application Insights details
azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS

# Open Azure Portal monitoring
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --app $(azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  --query "appId" -o tsv
```

### Live Metrics

1. Navigate to Application Insights in Azure Portal
2. Click "Live Metrics"
3. See real-time requests, failures, and performance
4. Test by running: `curl $(azd env get-values | grep API_GATEWAY_URL | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"')/api/products`

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add a New Product Endpoint ⭐ (Easy)

**Goal**: Add a POST endpoint to create new products

**Starting Point**: `src/product-service/main.py`

**Steps**:

1. Add this endpoint after the `get_product` function in `main.py`:

```python
@app.route('/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    """Create a new product"""
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Validate required fields
    if not data or 'name' not in data or 'price' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required fields: name, price'}), 400
    
    new_id = max(p['id'] for p in products) + 1
    new_product = {
        'id': new_id,
        'name': data['name'],
        'description': data.get('description', ''),
        'price': float(data['price']),
        'stock': int(data.get('stock', 0))
    }
    products.append(new_product)
    logger.info(f"Created product {new_id}")
    return jsonify(new_product), 201
```

2. Add POST route to API Gateway (`src/api-gateway/app.js`):

```javascript
// Add this after the GET /api/products route
app.post('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log(`Forwarding POST request to ${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`);
    const response = await axios.post(`${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`, req.body, {
      timeout: 5000
    });
    res.status(201).json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling product service:', error.message);
    res.status(503).json({
      error: 'Product service unavailable',
      message: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

3. Redeploy both services:

```bash
azd deploy product-service
azd deploy api-gateway
```

4. Test the new endpoint:

```bash
GATEWAY_URL=$(azd env get-values | grep API_GATEWAY_URL | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"')

# Create a new product
curl -X POST $GATEWAY_URL/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"USB Cable","price":9.99,"stock":500}'
```

**✅ Expected output:**
```json
{"id":6,"name":"USB Cable","description":"","price":9.99,"stock":500}
```

5. Verify it appears in the list:

```bash
curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products
# Should now show 6 products including the new USB Cable
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ POST request returns HTTP 201
- ✅ New product appears in GET /api/products list
- ✅ Product has auto-incremented ID

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

---

### Exercise 2: Modify Autoscaling Rules ⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Goal**: Adjust Product Service to scale more aggressively

**Starting Point**: `infra/app/product-service.bicep`

**Steps**:

1. Open `infra/app/product-service.bicep` and locate the `scale` block (around line 95)

2. Change from:
```bicep
scale: {
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules: [
    {
      name: 'http-scale-rule'
      http: {
        metadata: {
          concurrentRequests: '100'  // OLD
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To:
```bicep
scale: {
  minReplicas: 2  // Always have 2 running
  maxReplicas: 20  // Allow more scaling
  rules: [
    {
      name: 'http-scale-rule'
      http: {
        metadata: {
          concurrentRequests: '20'  // Scale at lower threshold
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Redeploy infrastructure:

```bash
azd up
```

4. Verify the new scaling configuration:

```bash
az containerapp show \
  --name $(azd env get-values | grep PRODUCT_SERVICE | head -1 | cut -d '/' -f5) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --query "properties.template.scale" -o json
```

**✅ Expected output:**
```json
{
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 20,
  "rules": [...]
}
```

5. Test autoscaling under load:

```bash
# Generate concurrent requests
for i in {1..500}; do curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products & done

# Watch scaling happen
azd logs product-service --follow
# Look for: Container Apps scaling events
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Product Service always runs at least 2 replicas
- ✅ Under load, scales to more than 2 replicas
- ✅ Azure Portal reflects the new scaling rules

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

### Exercise 3: Add Custom Monitoring Query ⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Goal**: Create a custom Application Insights query to monitor product API performance

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to Application Insights in Azure Portal:
   - Open Azure Portal
   - Locate your resource group (rg-microservices-*)
   - Select the Application Insights resource

2. Click "Logs" in the left menu

3. Create the following query:

```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where name contains "products"
| summarize 
    RequestCount = count(),
    AvgDuration = avg(duration),
    P95Duration = percentile(duration, 95),
    SuccessRate = 100.0 * countif(success == true) / count()
  by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

4. Click "Run" to execute the query

5. Save the query:
   - Click "Save"
   - Name: "Product API Performance"
   - Category: "Performance"

6. Generate test traffic:

```bash
for i in {1..100}; do curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products; sleep 1; done
```

7. Refresh the query to view data

**✅ Expected output:**
- Chart showing request counts over time
- Average duration < 500ms
- Success rate = 100%
- Time bins of 5 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Query shows 100+ requests
- ✅ Success rate is 100%
- ✅ Average duration < 500ms
- ✅ Chart displays 5-minute time bins

**Learning Outcome**: Learn how to monitor service performance using custom queries

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

### Exercise 4: Implement Retry Logic ⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)

**Goal**: Add retry logic to API Gateway for handling temporary unavailability of Product Service

**Starting Point**: `src/api-gateway/app.js`

**Steps**:

1. Install the retry library:

```bash
cd src/api-gateway
npm install axios-retry --save
cd ../..
```

2. Update `src/api-gateway/app.js` (add after axios import):

```javascript
const axiosRetry = require('axios-retry');

// Configure retry logic
axiosRetry(axios, {
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: (retryCount) => {
    return retryCount * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 3s
  },
  retryCondition: (error) => {
    // Retry on network errors or 5xx responses
    return axiosRetry.isNetworkOrIdempotentRequestError(error) ||
           (error.response && error.response.status >= 500);
  }
});

console.log('Retry logic configured: 3 retries with exponential backoff');
```

3. Redeploy API Gateway:

```bash
azd deploy api-gateway
```

4. Test retry behavior by simulating service failure:

```bash
# Scale product service to 0 (simulate failure)
az containerapp update \
  --name $(azd env get-values | grep PRODUCT_SERVICE | head -1 | cut -d '/' -f5) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --min-replicas 0 \
  --max-replicas 0

# Try to access products (will retry 3 times)
time curl -v $GATEWAY_URL/api/products
# Observe: Response takes ~6 seconds (1s + 2s + 3s retries)

# Restore product service
az containerapp update \
  --name $(azd env get-values | grep PRODUCT_SERVICE | head -1 | cut -d '/' -f5) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --min-replicas 1 \
  --max-replicas 10
```

5. View retry logs:

```bash
azd logs api-gateway --tail 50
# Look for: Retry attempt messages
```

**✅ Expected behavior:**
- Requests retry 3 times before failing
- Each retry waits longer (1s, 2s, 3s)
- Successful requests after service restarts
- Logs show retry attempts

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Requests retry 3 times before failing
- ✅ Each retry waits longer (exponential backoff)
- ✅ Successful requests after service restarts
- ✅ Logs show retry attempts

**Learning Outcome**: Understand resilience patterns in microservices (circuit breakers, retries, timeouts)

**Time**: 20-25 minutes

## Knowledge Checkpoint

After completing this example, confirm your understanding:

### 1. Service Communication ✓

Test your knowledge:
- [ ] Can you explain how API Gateway discovers the Product Service? (DNS-based service discovery)
- [ ] What happens if Product Service is down? (Gateway returns 503 error)
- [ ] How would you add a third service? (Create new Bicep file, add to main.bicep, create src folder)

**Hands-On Verification:**
```bash
# Simulate service failure
az containerapp update --name <product-service-name> --min-replicas 0 --max-replicas 0
curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products
# ✅ Expected: 503 Service Unavailable

# Restore service
az containerapp update --name <product-service-name> --min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 10
```

### 2. Monitoring & Observability ✓

Test your knowledge:
- [ ] Where do you see distributed logs? (Application Insights in Azure Portal)
- [ ] How do you track slow requests? (Kusto query: `requests | where duration > 1000`)
- [ ] Can you identify which service caused an error? (Check `cloud_RoleName` field in logs)

**Hands-On Verification:**
```bash
# Generate a slow request simulation
curl "$GATEWAY_URL/api/products?delay=2000"

# Query Application Insights for slow requests
# Navigate to Azure Portal → Application Insights → Logs
# Run: requests | where duration > 1000 | project timestamp, name, duration, cloud_RoleName
```

### 3. Scaling & Performance ✓

Test your knowledge:
- [ ] What triggers autoscaling? (HTTP concurrent request rules: 50 for gateway, 100 for product)
- [ ] How many replicas are running now? (Check with `az containerapp revision list`)
- [ ] How would you scale Product Service to 5 replicas? (Update minReplicas in Bicep)

**Hands-On Verification:**
```bash
# Generate load to test autoscaling
for i in {1..1000}; do curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products & done

# Watch replicas increase
azd logs api-gateway --follow
# ✅ Expected: See scaling events in logs
```

**Success Criteria**: You can answer all questions and verify with hands-on commands.

## Cost Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs (For This 2-Service Example)

| Resource | Configuration | Estimated Cost |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| API Gateway | 2-20 replicas, 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM | $30-150 |
| Product Service | 1-10 replicas, 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM | $15-75 |
| Container Registry | Basic tier | $5 |
| Application Insights | 1-2 GB/month | $5-10 |
| Log Analytics | 1 GB/month | $3 |
| **Total** | | **$58-243/month** |

### Cost Breakdown by Usage

**Light traffic** (testing/learning): ~$60/month
- API Gateway: 2 replicas × 24/7 = $30
- Product Service: 1 replica × 24/7 = $15
- Monitoring + Registry = $13

**Moderate traffic** (small production): ~$120/month
- API Gateway: 5 avg replicas = $75
- Product Service: 3 avg replicas = $45
- Monitoring + Registry = $13

**High traffic** (busy periods): ~$240/month
- API Gateway: 15 avg replicas = $225
- Product Service: 8 avg replicas = $120
- Monitoring + Registry = $13

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Scale to Zero for Development**:
   ```bicep
   scale: {
     minReplicas: 0  // Save $30-40/month when not in use
     maxReplicas: 10
   }
   ```

2. **Use Consumption Plan for Cosmos DB** (when you add it):
   - Pay only for what you use
   - No minimum charge

3. **Set Application Insights Sampling**:
   ```javascript
   appInsights.defaultClient.config.samplingPercentage = 50; // Sample 50% of requests
   ```

4. **Clean Up When Not Needed**:
   ```bash
   azd down --force --purge
   ```

### Free Tier Options

For learning/testing, consider:
- ✅ Use Azure free credits ($200 for first 30 days with new accounts)
- ✅ Keep to minimum replicas (saves ~50% costs)
- ✅ Delete after testing (no ongoing charges)
- ✅ Scale to zero between learning sessions

**Example**: Running this example for 2 hours/day × 30 days = ~$5/month instead of $60/month

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Problem: `azd up` fails with "Subscription not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Log in again with explicit subscription
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your-subscription-id>
azd up
```

### Problem: API Gateway returns 503 "Product service unavailable"

**Diagnose**:
```bash
# Check product service logs
azd logs product-service --tail 50

# Check product service health
az containerapp show \
  --name $(azd env get-values | grep PRODUCT_SERVICE | head -1 | cut -d '/' -f5) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --query "properties.runningStatus"
```

**Common Causes**:
1. Product service didn't start (check logs for Python errors)
2. Health check failing (verify `/health` endpoint works)
3. Container image build failed (check registry for image)

### Problem: Autoscaling not working

**Diagnose**:
```bash
# Check current replica count
az containerapp revision list \
  --name $(azd env get-values | grep API_GATEWAY | head -1 | cut -d '/' -f5) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --query "[].properties.replicas"

# Generate load to test
for i in {1..1000}; do curl $GATEWAY_URL/api/products & done

# Watch scaling events
azd logs api-gateway --follow | grep -i scale
```

**Common Causes**:
1. Load not high enough to trigger scale rule (need >50 concurrent requests)
2. Max replicas already reached (check Bicep configuration)
3. Scale rule misconfigured in Bicep (verify concurrentRequests value)

### Problem: Application Insights not showing logs

**Diagnose**:
```bash
# Verify connection string is set
azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS

# Check if services are sending telemetry
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --app $(azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_NAME | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"') \
  --query "properties.InstrumentationKey"
```

**Common Causes**:
1. Connection string not passed to container (check environment variables)
2. Application Insights SDK not configured (verify imports in code)
3. Firewall blocking telemetry (rare, check network rules)

### Problem: Docker build fails locally

**Diagnose**:
```bash
# Test API Gateway build
cd src/api-gateway
docker build -t test-gateway .

# Test Product Service build
cd ../product-service
docker build -t test-product .
```

**Common Causes**:
1. Missing dependencies in package.json/requirements.txt
2. Dockerfile syntax errors
3. Network issues downloading dependencies

**Still Stuck?** See [Common Issues Guide](../../docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.md) or [Azure Container Apps Troubleshooting](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/troubleshooting)

---

## Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, delete all resources:

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

**Confirmation Prompt**:
```
? Total resources to delete: 6, are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
```

Type `y` to confirm.

**What Gets Deleted**:
- Container Apps Environment
- Both Container Apps (gateway & product service)
- Container Registry
- Application Insights
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Resource Group

**✓ Verify Cleanup**:
```bash
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'rg-microservices')]" --output table
```

Should return empty.

## Expansion Guide: From 2 to 5+ Services

Once you've mastered this 2-service architecture, here's how to expand:

### Phase 1: Add Database Persistence (Next Step)

**Add Cosmos DB for Product Service**:

1. Create `infra/core/cosmos.bicep`:
   ```bicep
   resource cosmosAccount 'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts@2023-04-15' = {
     name: name
     location: location
     kind: 'GlobalDocumentDB'
     properties: {
       databaseAccountOfferType: 'Standard'
       consistencyPolicy: { defaultConsistencyLevel: 'Session' }
       locations: [{ locationName: location, failoverPriority: 0 }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update product service to use Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK instead of in-memory data

3. Estimated additional cost: ~$25/month (serverless)

### Phase 2: Add Third Service (Order Management)

**Create Order Service**:

1. New folder: `src/order-service/` (Python/Node.js/C#)
2. New Bicep: `infra/app/order-service.bicep`
3. Update API Gateway to route `/api/orders`
4. Add Azure SQL Database for order persistence

**Architecture becomes**:
```
API Gateway → Product Service (Cosmos DB)
           → Order Service (Azure SQL)
```

### Phase 3: Add Async Communication (Service Bus)

**Implement Event-Driven Architecture**:

1. Add Azure Service Bus: `infra/core/servicebus.bicep`
2. Product Service publishes "ProductCreated" events
3. Order Service subscribes to product events
4. Add Notification Service to process events

**Pattern**: Request/Response (HTTP) + Event-Driven (Service Bus)

### Phase 4: Add User Authentication

**Implement User Service**:

1. Create `src/user-service/` (Go/Node.js)
2. Add Azure AD B2C or custom JWT authentication
3. API Gateway validates tokens before routing
4. Services check user permissions

### Phase 5: Production Readiness

**Add These Components**:
- ✅ Azure Front Door (global load balancing)
- ✅ Azure Key Vault (secret management)
- ✅ Azure Monitor Workbooks (custom dashboards)
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Blue-Green Deployments
- ✅ Managed Identity for all services

**Full Production Architecture Cost**: ~$300-1,400/month

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why only 2 services instead of 5+?**  
A: To ensure a smooth learning curve. Master the basics (service communication, monitoring, scaling) with a simple example before introducing more complexity. The principles you learn here can be applied to architectures with 100 services.

**Q: Can I add more services myself?**  
A: Absolutely! Follow the expansion guide above. Each new service follows the same steps: create a `src` folder, create a Bicep file, update `azure.yaml`, and deploy.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: It's a strong starting point. For production, consider adding: managed identity, Key Vault, persistent databases, a CI/CD pipeline, monitoring alerts, and a backup strategy.

**Q: Why not use Dapr or other service mesh?**  
A: To keep things simple for learning purposes. Once you understand the native networking in Container Apps, you can add Dapr for advanced features (state management, pub/sub, bindings).

**Q: How do I debug locally?**  
A: Run the services locally using Docker:  
```bash
cd src/api-gateway
docker build -t local-gateway .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000 local-gateway
```


**Q: Can I use different programming languages?**  
A: Yes! This example uses Node.js (gateway) and Python (product service). You can mix any languages that run in containers: C#, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, etc.

**Q: What if I don't have Azure credits?**  
A: Use the Azure free tier (new accounts get $200 in credits for the first 30 days) or deploy for short testing periods and delete resources immediately. This example costs about $2/day.

**Q: How is this different from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?**  
A: Container Apps is simpler (no Kubernetes expertise required) but less flexible. AKS provides full Kubernetes control but demands more knowledge. Start with Container Apps and move to AKS if necessary.

**Q: Can I use this with existing Azure services?**  
A: Yes! You can connect to existing databases, storage accounts, Service Bus, etc. Just update the Bicep files to reference existing resources instead of creating new ones.
