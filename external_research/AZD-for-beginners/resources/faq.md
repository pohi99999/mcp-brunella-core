## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Q: What Azure services can azd deploy?
**A**: azd can deploy any Azure service through Bicep/ARM templates, including:
- App Services, Container Apps, Functions
- Databases (SQL, PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB)
- Storage, Key Vault, Application Insights
- Networking, security, and monitoring resources

### Q: Can I deploy to multiple regions?
**A**: Yes, configure multiple regions in your Bicep templates and set the location parameter appropriately for each environment.

### Q: How do I handle database schema migrations?
**A**: Use deployment hooks in `azure.yaml`:
```yaml
hooks:
  postdeploy:
    posix:
      run: ./scripts/migrate-database.sh
    windows:
      run: ./scripts/migrate-database.ps1
```

### Q: Can I deploy only infrastructure without applications?
**A**: Yes, use `azd provision` to deploy only the infrastructure components defined in your templates.

### Q: How do I deploy to existing Azure resources?
**A**: This is complex and not directly supported. You can:
1. Import existing resources into your Bicep templates
2. Use existing resource references in templates
3. Modify templates to conditionally create or reference resources

### Q: Can I use Terraform instead of Bicep?
**A**: Currently, azd primarily supports Bicep/ARM templates. Terraform support is not officially available, though community solutions may exist.

## Configuration & Environments

### Q: How do I manage different environments (dev, staging, prod)?
**A**: Create separate environments with `azd env new <environment-name>` and configure different settings for each:
```bash
azd env new development
azd env new staging  
azd env new production
```

### Q: Where are environment configurations stored?
**A**: In the `.azure` folder within your project directory. Each environment has its own folder with configuration files.

### Q: How do I set environment-specific configuration?
**A**: Use `azd env set` to configure environment variables:
```bash
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus
azd env set DATABASE_TIER Basic
```

### Q: Can I share environment configurations across team members?
**A**: The `.azure` folder contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control. Instead:
1. Document required environment variables
2. Use deployment scripts to set up environments
3. Use Azure Key Vault for sensitive configuration

### Q: How do I override template defaults?
**A**: Set environment variables that correspond to template parameters:
```bash
azd env set LOCATION "West US 2"
azd env set SKU_NAME "B1"
```
