## Deprovision Infra

1. To break down di infrastructure na as simple as:
      
      ```bash title="" linenums="0"
      azd down --purge
      ```
1. Di `--purge` flag go make sure say e also clear soft-deleted Cognitive Service resources, so e go free di quota wey dey hold by dis resources. When e finish, you go see something like dis:
      
      ```bash title="" linenums="0"
      ? Total resources to delete: 11, are you sure you want to continue? Yes
      Deleting your resources can take some time.
      (✓) Done: Deleted resource group rg-nitya-mshack-azd
      (✓) Done: Purging Cognitive Account: aoai-3cz3zkynhvpbc

      SUCCESS: Your application was removed from Azure in 11 minutes 4 seconds.
      ```

1. (Optional) If you run `azd up` again now, you go notice say di gpt-4.1 model go deploy because di environment variable don change (and e don save) for di local `.azure` folder. 

      Dis na di model deployments **before**:
